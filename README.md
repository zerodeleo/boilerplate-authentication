## ðŸ’»ðŸ’»ðŸ’» MERN-STACK BOILERPLATE
Follow these easy steps and you will have a fullstack MERN application up and running within 10min.
âœ… Basic authentication service
âœ… Uploading images to cloudinary

This setup includes managing state asynchronously with useContext OR react-redux.

When I started coding I spent so many hours trying to figure out how to create the perfect work environment for my fullstack applications. How do I get it up and running...?

Here you have my boilerplate for a fully functional MERN-stack application with basic authentication. I use this boilerplate whenever I create my MVPs.
Kudos to Christian Ek for encrypting the password.

### This is a WIP repo.
- TS will be implemented
- âœ… Tailwind will be added
- âœ… the Redux state management will be refactored to use Redux slices
- Etc.

### These are the FAQ that I had which this boilerplate covers:
- How do I deploy my app?
- How do I connect my app to a db?
- How do I manage my db schema?
- How do I manage my state?
- How do I connect my backend with my frontend?
- How do I setup my API?
- Backend routing?
- Frontend routing?
- How do I authenticate a user?
